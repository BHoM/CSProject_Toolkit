# CSProject_Toolkit
This toolkit allows for pulling CSProject data into BHoM via an adapter. This toolkit utilises [Buildalyzer](https://github.com/daveaglick/Buildalyzer) to query data from a CSProject file and create BHoM object representations of that data.

This toolkit is primarily for DevOps operations within BHoM, aiding of BHoMBot querying CSProject data in a format BHoMBot can easily work with, but is provided here as a toolkit for the open source community to utilise and collaborate on to further BHoM's ability to query CSProject data.

Currently this works with the new CSProject format (used with .Net Standard 2.0 and .Net 5). Contributions for supporting other CSProject versions are welcome! :rocket:
